 Setting up this post was different in many ways. During this summer I became more acquainted with the command prompt through a summer internship, but this took it a bit further by having to update the bundle and move through each directory to have to interact with jekyll. I understand mostly how it works, but what I don’t understand is why I can’t directly manage the webpage using Github Pages 
 and Atom. Although, there were many missteps along the way to this blog being created I look forward to:
 * Working with Jekyll more
 * Learning how this helps us with databases
 * Interacting more with our blog website
 * Designing it to look a bit different.
