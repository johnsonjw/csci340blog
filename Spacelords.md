	<p class="intro">the game we’ll be discussing today is Spacelords. Initially called Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spacelords, is a completely free to play 4v1 pve, pvp third person shooter. To start off I’ll talk about my first impressions as well as some of the gameplay aspects that I liked initially, then I’ll give you the stuff I don’t like, and finally give my final feelings on the game. My first thoughts of this game was that it could not possibly be free. It was as if a Triple A gaming company had decided to finally make a free to play game. The reason as to why I say this is because of the look of the game. Personally I’m not a stickler for graphics, I always did my gaming on a mediocre laptop, so I won’t typically notice if my framerate drops by 1 or if the lighting is particularly off unless it’s extremely noticeable. So after playing this on the PS4 and saying that the visual glitches that I experienced were minimal for the majority of the time, but there was the occasional texture that would pop in while traversing the level, which didn’t bother me that much. However I know some of those out there care immensely about this and I’m pretty sure that’s due to the PS4, but I could always be wrong. Moving on to FPS drops, that’s also due to the PS4. When it comes to a lot of things coming on the screen at once, then the game becomes this freeze frame mess that usually ends up in the death of the player. Other than these two things for the most part everything else is beautifully animated, the cutscenes are enjoyable for the most part. Every time I did a new mission I would find myself interested in seeing the dynamic of the cast play out. Speaking of well... speech this is a great segway into the voice acting. It is not great and I mean that in the nicest way possible.</p>
